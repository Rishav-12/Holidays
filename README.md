# Holidays
A fun Python script that uses an api to get you the holidays of any place you want on a given day

### Description
* It uses an api call to fetch the data
* Then it transforms it into a json and parses it to get useful information
* Finally it serves that information to the user

### How to use
* Generate an api key from calendarific.com
* Create a file *api_key.txt*, put your api key in and keep it beside the python script
* Run the script from your console
* I also used Task Scheduler on Windows to run this script everyday
